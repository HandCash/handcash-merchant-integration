# BIP270 Payment Requests

## Overview

BIP270 requests are dynamically served and are a fully peer-to-peer. These requests are made by providing a direct URI, pointing to a webserver, which will serve transaction data to the customer. 

Here are the required steps for a successful BIP270 transaction:
- The customer engages the invoice URI.
- The requester sends data to construct the tx.
- The customer constructs and signs the tx and sends it to the requester.
- The requester accepts the tx, the tx is broadcast, and a successful state is returned to the customer. 

## Implementation

To start, you will need to generate an invoice URL and provide it to your customer. The URL must be formatted into a URI with the following format:

`pay:?r=https://<url>`

This URI can also be imbedded into a QR Code, so that it may be scanned.

Once the URI is engaged by the customer, they will fetch the tx template from your server.

That request, should be responded to by returning an *object* with the following fields:

| Name           | Expected Value                                                             |Type      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |------
| network (**required**)        | bitcoin-sv                          |string     |
| expirationTimestamp        | unix timestamp                     |number     |
| creationTimestamp (**required**)       | unix timestamp                     |number     |
| paymentUrl (**required**) | URL to deliver signed tx to   |string     |
| memo  | any length is accepted, only first 25 chars accepted   |string     |
| outputs (**required**) | an array of outputs, each array object must contain "script" and "amount"   |array     |
| ├► script  | P2PKH script   |string     |
| └► amount  | output amount in satoshis   |number     |
| merchantData  | an object containing "avatarUrl" and "merchantName"  |Object     |
| ├► avatarUrl  | A URL for the logo of the requester's business or shop   |string     |
| └► merchantName  | The name of the requester's business or shop   |string     |

Once the customer makes a confirmation, they will send a response to the *paymentURL*, with the sign transaction:
`{ transaction: txhex }`

When the signed tx is recieved, you will check to see the transaction is valid (and optionally broadcast the tx as you like), and respond with:
`{ success: true }`


## Example 

We can use BIP270 requests to charge for a cup of coffee, plus a tip for the server.

We first present the customer with a invoice URL:
![QRCode](/../resources/images/bip270qr.png ':class=qrcode') 
<center><a href="pay:?r=http://142.93.157.92:3000/">Pay</a></center>

Once the customer engages the URL you send back a transaction template.

- **restaurant address**: 1EQtNGbqq2Zhpqhwaf9dCuAjvQz7eAWcHy
- **server address**: 12gqniN78jNfSVama77m3niPKTpdmb8QEF
- **amount**: 0.01533906
- **tip**: 0.00432145
- **merchant name**: Joe's Café
- **link to avatar**: https://bit.ly/3f1fMX7

```
{
  "network": "bitcoin-sv",
  "outputs": [{
    "script": "76a91419e92fd0ec80a7bc8681e845d4575c28c38d052488ac",
    "amount": 1223506,
  },
  {
    "script": "76a91412811318c9cec427051555adadaf3343bb8a125588ac",
    "amount": 310400,
  }],
  "creationTimestamp": 1588222180,
  "expirationTimestamp": 1596222180,
  "paymentUrl": "http://142.93.157.92:3000/paid",
  "memo": "this is for coffee",
  "merchantData": "{\"avatarUrl\":\"https://bit.ly/3f1fMX7\",\"merchantName\":\"Joes Café\"}",
}
```

The customer receives the tx template and is presented with a payment confirmation screen:

![Scanned](/../resources/images/simple-pr-scanned.png ':class=screenshot')

The customer swipes right to confirm the payment and you receive a signed txhex in the following format:
```
{ transaction: '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' }
```

The transaction is checked for validity, and your server responds with the following:

`{ success: true }`
