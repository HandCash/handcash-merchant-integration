# Quick Start

## Overview
There are two types of payment requests **simple payment requests** and **BIP270 payment requests**. These can be presented to a user in one of two forms: **URI** or **QR Code**.

## Getting started

To start, you will want to decide which is right for you: 

[**Simple Payments**](simple-payments.md)

`bitcoin:<address>?sv=&amount=<bsvAmount>&label=<merchantName>&avatarUrl=<linkToAvatar>`

Simple payment requests are great for payments with basic functionality, and they can even be customed to showcase your brand.

[**BIP270 Payments**](bip270-payments.md)

`pay:?r=https://<url>`

BIP270 requests are capable of much more dynamic transactions than simple payment requests, and they are 100% peer-to-peer.
