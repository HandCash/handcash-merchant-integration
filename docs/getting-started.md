# Quick Start

## Overview
There are two types of payment requests **Merchant Payments (Recommended)** and **Legacy Payments (Deprecated)**. These can be presented to a user in one of two forms: **URI** or **QR Code**.

## Getting started

To start, you will want to decide which is right for you: 

[**legacy Payments**](legacy-payments.md)

`bitcoin:<address>?sv=&amount=<amount>&label=<name>&avatarUrl=<avatar>`

Legacy payment requests are great for payments with basic functionality, and they can even be customized to showcase your brand.

[**Merchant Payments**](merchant-payments.md)

`pay:?r=<url>`

Merchant requests are capable of much more dynamic transactions than Legacy requests, and they are 100% peer-to-peer.
